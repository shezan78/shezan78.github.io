            Proteins are essential for the growth, repair, and maintenance of the body's tissues. They are also important for the production of enzymes, hormones, and other molecules that are necessary for the body's functions. Adequate intake of protein is also important for maintaining a healthy immune system and preserving muscle mass during weight loss or aging.
